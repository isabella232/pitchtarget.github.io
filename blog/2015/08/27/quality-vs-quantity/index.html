                <p>Facebook is a very powerful communication channel. With its 1.5 billion users it represents a huge opportunity for marketers. A Page can be easily created and gives a business the chance to be present actively on Facebook. While creating a Page is a simple process though, managing it appropriately may not be that straightforward. 
                In this article we offer some helpful tips to take advantage of Facebook commercial possibilities in the best way.</p>
                
                <p></p>
                
                <hr />
                
                <p>Facebook’s user base can now count almost <strong>1.5 billion users</strong> online every month, with more than 900 million people checking it every day (according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102273332210821">latest report</a>), and the numbers are expected to grow further as Facebook keeps investing to improve its services and getting more people online. This titanic amount of users translates into a colossal opportunity for marketers, that are provided with an unprecedented communication channel.</p>
                
                <p>The free tools that allow businesses to have voices and presence on Facebook are the Pages. They allow to promote a brand, to find new customers and to build relationships with them. <strong>Pages are very powerful tools but, like all the tools, they need to be properly used in order to be effective.
                It is critical to understand that they are more than simple billboards or TV spots, since they give businesses the possibility to create interactive connections with their customers.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Exactly for this reason, creating Facebook Pages is not enough to fully exploit their communicating potential. They are dynamic tools, and thus they need to be managed.</p>
                
                <p>At this point the question arises spontaneously:</p>
                
                <h3 id="how-can-i-make-the-best-out-of-my-facebook-page"><em>How can I make the best out of my Facebook Page?</em></h3>
                
                <p>The answer is shockingly simple, and can be summed up with the mantra “<strong>quality is better than quantity</strong>”.
                While this may not always be true, it definitely is in this case, and now we will see why.</p>
                
                <p>It’s easy to be dazzled by Facebook’s massive amount of users and the ease with which is possible to reach them through a Page can be misleading. Often Facebook advertisers (not only beginners) make the mistake of focusing their efforts in reaching as many people as possible, without considering the value of the contents they are delivering. They focus on quantity rather than on quality, hence failing to properly exploit the potential of their Pages. Facebook itself has recently took <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/update-to-facebook-news-feed">clear provisions</a> to increase the quality level of posts contents.</p>
                
                <h3 id="and-what-does-quality-mean-in-facebook-terms"><em>And what does quality mean in Facebook terms?</em></h3>
                
                <p>According to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed">its own estimates</a> the typical user could see around 1,500 stories in a given day, but Facebook shows in the News Feed only the 300 stories they believe the user will be most likely to care about<sup id="fnref:footnote"><a href="#fn:footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, according to their ranking algorithm. 
                This is because “<em>the goal of News Feed is to deliver the right content to the right people at the right time so they don’t miss the stories that are important to them.</em>”</p>
                
                <p>From this statement it is possible to deduce that <strong>for Facebook high quality content means one that is tailored according to the interests of the people it has been created for</strong>.
                Even though this may sound trivial, it is not at all: in order to gain a place in a user’s News Feed, a business post has to compete not only against other businesses, but also against the stories of the people connected to that user.</p>
                
                <p>This means that a post created for commercial purpose has to be relevant enough in user’s opinion to compete against, for instance, the photos of a best friend’s wedding or the check-in in a restaurant of someone interesting.</p>
                
                <p>Therefore to deliver high quality content, it is necessary to understand what is interesting for a user. But to be able to do this, it is crucial to identify which kind of user is being addressed.
                It is for this reason that the approach “reaching as many people as possible” does not work effectively: in order for a business Page to be successful, it has to address the interests of some specific people, not everyone, but someone who can be interested in what that business has to offer and thus will be more willing to interact with the Page. In other words, it has to focus on its customers.</p>
                
                <h3 id="but-how-it-is-possible-to-identify-customers-on-the-wide-wild-facebook"><em>But how it is possible to identify customers on the wide wild Facebook?</em></h3>
                
                <p>Luckily, Facebook itself provides an excellent solution to this problem: sponsored contents.
                <strong>Through Facebook Ads it is possible to target people whose interests coincide with what a business has to offer, people that will build up a relevant Fan base which will become the core audience of the business Page</strong>.
                Using targeted Ads has a cost, and of course one would want to limit costs as much as possible.</p>
                
                <p>However, it is important to remember that quality should not be sacrificed in this process: here the aim is not to get as many Fans as possible at the lowest cost, but to <a href="http://www.jonloomer.com/2013/09/04/facebook-sales-funnel/">get the right Fans spending the least amount of money</a>. 
                The right Fans would be people whose interests genuinely match with the business offer, and that thus will more likely engage actively with the Page.</p>
                
                <p>To be clear, being able to reach a large number of people is not a bad thing per se, provided that there is having a precise target in mind. 
                Even though acquiring this type of Fan base may be more expensive, it would definitely pay off in the long term,  providing a better return on investment.</p>

                <h3 id="hence-page-content-must-be-relevant-but-what-does-this-mean"><em>Hence, Page content must be relevant. But what does this mean?</em></h3>
                
                <p>A Page is what links a business website to Facebook. A business should invest in its website in order for it to provide a great user experience and relevant content. Relevant content must provide value to targeted customers. This implies that <strong>a business Page should not deliver only promotional content</strong>, describing how good its products or services are and for example, redirecting customers to the website’s add-to-cart landing page, <strong>but it should also provide content of educational or entertaining nature, suited to the needs of its audience</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>For example, a business selling gardening tools could provide content about how to properly take care of plants, or a business selling sports articles could post stories about dieting or how to design a training workout.
                At the beginning it might be helpful to deliver content with a relatively high frequency to increase engagement, but in the long term it is not necessary to flood followers with posts, because they could be annoyed, especially with promotional content.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, the Page gives the chance to establish a personal connection between the users and the business. It is a place where a business can enhance the experience it offers to its customer through direct interaction, and thus needs to be carefully and actively managed.</p>
                
                <p>So, to quickly summarize the main points of our recipe for a performing Facebook Page:</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Invest in the website</strong>: build well designed and captivating landing pages."</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Build an high quality Fan base</strong>: the aim is not to reach as many people as possible, but to reach the right people.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Provide high quality, relevant content</strong>: not just promotional, but also educational and engaging.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Provide an high quality user experience</strong>: manage actively the Page, supporting the users.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

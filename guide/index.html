                          The first step in order to be able to use Pitchtarget is to provide a valid email address for the registration, which do not have to necessarily be the address linked to your Facebook account. <br> After having signed up into Pitchtarget, the next step would be to login with Facebook and give to the Pitchtarget Facebook App the required permissions.

                            Conversion Pixels are the elements that allows you to accurately keep track of your Facebook Ads performance. The purpose of Pixels is to track what offsite actions are taken by users interacting with your ads. Pixels allows to identify which ads led to conversions on your website. Conversions may be of various types, for example registrations, sales, page views or add to cart actions.
                          </p>
                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            A Conversion Pixel is a Javascript code snippet that in order to work needs to be copied and pasted between  <head> and </head> on the HTML code of the web page where you want to track conversions.
                          </p>
                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            Pitchtarget can create Conversion Pixels for you, for whatever type of conversion you like, but it will not be automatically added into your website. You can do it by yourself following
                            <a href='https://www.facebook.com/business/help/435189689870514'>these instructions</a>
                            or you can ask for assistance from an expert (like your webmaster).

                            The Custom Audience Pixel is used to create Website Custom Audiences, which represent any group of customers or prospective customers that express interest in your product on your website. Custom Audiences are created by comparing data about website’s traffic and Facebook’s own data.

                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            Though Facebook Ads can work even without Pixels implementation, they are strongly suggested in order to fully exploit the tool’s tracking and optimization features.

                            A Strategy is a sort of repository for Facebook campaigns. It will help you to organize more clearly Facebook campaigns related to different market areas of your business or to the various brands of the company.
                          </p>
                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            We developed the Strategy level in order for our users to better organize their advertising efforts. Strategies are conceived to group together campaigns that are part of the same marketing plan of your business.
                          </p>
                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            All the campaigns in a Strategy refers to a single Facebook Ad Account and Page.

                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            Hence, at this point of the creation process you will just need to select the Ad Account you want to use for the Strategy, specify the Page you want to advertise and give a name to your Strategy.

                            A campaign is a grouping of ad sets which are organized by the same business objective. It helps you optimize and measure the result of your ads.

                            To enable the campaign to do this, the first thing that is necessary to do is to choose the objective that will correlate every ad set within the campaign.

                            Your advertising objective is what you want people to do when they see your ads. It is very important to have clearly in mind what you want to achieve with your Facebook ads and choose the objective of the campaign correspondingly, because the software will automatically optimize your ads to help you realize your goals in the best way.

                            The first step in order to set up a campaign is thus to select one out of the following seven objectives:

                                the goal is to increase engagement in your posts and get people seeing, liking, commenting on and sharing your Page content. Use this campaign when you need to boost the virality of your posts. You are allowed to choose Video or Photo Posts as creatives with this objective.

                                the main focus of this campaign is to drive traffic to your website. These ads will redirect people to your website and you can optionally add a call to action button, for example “Learn More”, to encourage visitors to take that specific action when landing on your website.

                                this type of campaign helps you drive more installs for your native mobile apps (iOS or Android). If you want to choose this type of campaign make sure to register your mobile app with Facebook first. You can use pictures or videos in your ads to link people to the app store where they can install your app. If you want to measure exactly the number of app installs, you can integrate your app with the Facebook SDK. This type of campaign also allows you to bid for a cost per action, so you will only pay when people install your app.

                                mobile App engagement ads help drive engagement and conversion for your app with ads that take users to a customized location within your app (iOS or Android). For example, a travel app can target its existing users with relevant flight deals and add a "Book Now" call to action button to its Ads. When a person clicks on the button, she will be sent straight into the app to the advertised flight deal. A mobile game, instead, could run an ad targeting its players and challenge them with a "Play Game" call to action by sending them to play a new game level or start a match. If you want to measure the success of your ad, you can integrate your app with the Facebook SDK.

At the moment it is not possible to use the Spend Cap option for smaller amounts. For sums lower than 100 € the option will return an error and you will have to choose whether to not specify any cap at all or simply set 100 € as your upper limit of expense (we suggest you to always set the Spend Cap to avoid unpleasant surprises that may be caused by accidental oversights).

In order to be able to use pixels, you will first need to create and implement them (as specified in the section 1.2 of this guide). You can select more than one pixel at the same time within a single campaign, in order to be able to break your analysis down in an even more detailed way. We suggest you to use the pixels to fully take advantage of the tools provided by Facebook. However, if for some reason you are not interested in employing them, you will still be able to track the results of your advertising investments (although with less details).

                            An ad set is a group of ads that share the same daily or lifetime budget, schedule, bid type, bid info, and targeting data. This will help you control the amount you spend on each audience, decide when each audience will see your ads, and see metrics specific to each audience. You can create many ad sets within the same campaign, which is useful if you want to run a campaign with the same objective while targeting different audiences.

                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            The first step to do in order to create an ad set is to specify a target audience. The target audience is the specific group of people within your target market at which your product or the marketing message of the product is aimed.
                          </p>
                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            Thanks to target audiences you can deliver relevant messages to specific people and get the most value from your advert spend by reaching only the people that matter to you.
                          </p>
                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            Pitchtarget allows you to create target audiences specifying for a large number of characteristics, always telling you the estimated reach for the choices you are making. It is up to you to choose how specific you want your target audience to be, according to the knowledge you have of your target market and to the objective of your campaign. In general however, a relatively broad audience may be preferred if your objective is to build brand awareness, while a narrowly defined might be better if you want people to take a specific action on Facebook or on your website or app (such as registrations or purchases).

                                  Once you specified an appropriate name for your new target audience, you must specify one or more locations. Locations will be the point from which you can start carving your target. It is possible to set a whole country (or more than one) as target location (e.g., United States, Italy, ecc..) or be more precise and select a specific city. In case you select one or more cities, you will also be able to specify the radius (ranging from 17 km to 80 km) of the areas surrounding the selected locations to be included in the target locations.

                                  After you named your target and chose its location, it is already suitable for implementation. However, since it is possible to overlay several targeting options you may want to add some more details to improve target’s accuracy. <br>You can target people based on demographics such as age, gender and languages or on advanced demographics such as: educational background, working experience, relationship status, family status, politics, life events, generation, ethnic affinity, industries and sexual interest.

                                  You can also define your ideal target of people by their interests, hobbies and Pages they like on Facebook.

                                  It is also possible to reach people based on their purchasing behavior and device usage, to include or exclude people who are connected to your pages and their friends and Custom Audiences.

                                  Finally, you can choose the Placement of your ads among Desktop News Feed, Right-hand Side Column, Mobile News Feed (iOS, Android or both) and Third Party Apps.

                                  Moreover, Pitchtarget automatically  stores each audience you create in the Target Templates section, so you can reuse your target audiences whenever you want without having to recreate them from scratch each time. You can draw your audience from the Target Templates by selecting it while in the “New Target” section of the ad set creation process.

                            The Target Templates can also be accessed anytime by clicking into the “Targets” section in the header of the app. Within this section it is possible to easily create Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences starting from your Custom Audiences, to find people who are similar to your current customers.

You will be able to choose among a set of optimization goals pertaining to the objective of your Campaign. If you do not specify an optimization goal, the default one will be the most tightly associated with the Campaign’s objective.

                            Once the ad set has been created, we can create one or more ads for that ad set. An ad object contains the data necessary to visually display an ad and associate it with a corresponding ad set. Each ad is associated with an ad set and all ads in a set have the same daily or lifetime budget, schedule, and targeting. Creating multiple ads in each ad set will let us optimize their delivery based on variations in images, links, video, text or placements.

                            There are in total five different types of ads that can be created, however their availability vary according to the objective of the campaign for which the ads are being created.

                              This kind of ads is designed to send people to important sections of your website or App. It is available for the objectives Send People to your website, Increase App Installs, Increase App Engagement and Increase Conversions on your Website. Link Ads can be optimized to get people to take specific actions on your website or App: conversions, such as signing up for a newsletter or buying a product, as well as App installs and engagement. To create a Link Ad, you will have several editing options: it is possible to insert short Post messages (up to 60 characters long), a link headline (max 13 characters long), a description for the link, a Call to Action button, and of course the URL of the link to be posted. Moreover, since it can happen quite often for some links to look “ugly”, you can choose to insert a brief “Display link” title that will be shown instead of the effective URL of the link you want to post. Finally, for the objectives Increase App Install and App Engagement, it is possible to insert “deep links” that link to a specific location within a mobile app, rather than simply launching it.

                              Video are one of the most engaging items you can find on a social network. Video Ads are available for the following objectives: Boost Post, Send People to your Website, Video Views, Increase Conversions on your Website and Promote your Page. To create Video Ads you need to upload a video (even very short videos can be a powerful tool to engage your audience), choose a Post title and insert an optional Post message (max 90 characters long). Eventually you can also add a Call to Action button to promote specific actions.

                              Also known as “Carousel Ad”, this type of ad is usable for the objectives Send People to your Website or Increase conversions on your Website. It showcases simultaneously up to five images and links within a single ad unit to direct people to specific locations on your website. Since they give the possibility to show many products at the same time they are very effective for conversion campaigns. Moreover, Multiproduct Ads give the chance to unleash your creativity: thanks to their stream of photos\links they allow to tell stories to the customers in a very entertaining and engaging way. To produce a Multiproduct Ad you will need to insert a general Post message (max 90 character long), a general post link and eventually a display link. Then you can edit the single posts content, uploading one picture, a name (max 35 characters long), a brief description (max 30 characters long) a link and an eventual Call to Action button. Even though a Multiproduct Ad can’t exhibit more than five product posts at a time, it is possible to prepare up to ten different product posts. When more than five product posts are created, enabling the Creative Optimization option will let Pitchtarget automatically select and order the best images and links out of those uploaded.

                                  Not all apps have been created to run both on iOS and Android, still, many of them are made to do so. This means that if you want advertise such an app you will have to create two ads, one for iOS users and one for Android users. This can be quite a boring process, given that you are advertising the same product. Pitchtarget can help you avoid this nuisance: it automatically detects the operative system for which the app has been created and if it has been developed for both iOS and Android, Pitchtarget will automatically duplicate the creative producing two ads, one crafted for each operative system. And the best part is that you don’t even have to ask for it!

                                  Going each time through the whole ad’s creative production process can be very time consuming, especially if you need to use similar ads over and over again. One more time, Pitchtarget helps you speeding up the process with Ad Library. The Ad Library allows you to reuse your previously created ads every time you like. In this way, for example, you don’t have to waste time if you need to create similar ads for different ad sets.

So, if you published a particularly engaging post, photo or video, you could use them as creatives for your new ads effortlessly.

We did this because we want you to be able to control every aspect of your advertising activity on Facebook.

                            Facebook gives its users the possibility to promote their posts through the Boost Post feature. Being a kind of ads, boosted posts have more visibility than normal posts. We find this feature to be very useful to improve the performance of businesses on Facebook, because it allows to enhance the effectiveness of their best posts, highlighting the most attractive contents of a Page. While being definitely valuable, Boost Post has a scalability issue. Indeed, while monitoring and setting a boost post is not a difficult or time-expensive task per se, as the number of boosted posts increases so does the cost of investing time in their creation. A relatively simple and quick task then becomes an exhausting set of repetitive and tedious tasks.

Thanks to the ability to operate on numerous elements simultaneously, each post can be boosted at the same time without having to click through each one of them.

                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            Right after having defined a new Strategy, you are given the possibility to create an ordinary campaign or alternatively, you can choose to create an Automatic Boost Posts campaign.
                          </p>
                        </div>

                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            All you have to do is just set once the rules of an Automatic Boost Posts campaign and then it will automatically operate according to the specified criteria, activating the boosts only when appropriate. Once created, the automation can also be saved for future usage. To create the automation, you first need to specify the name of the new Automatic Boost Posts rule, the post watching time (the number of hours for which the automation will check for each post metric performance), the age of the posts to be included in the campaign and whether to boost all of them simultaneously or only the latest that match the “Trigger”. The next step would be to actually define the “Trigger”, which is the set containing the rules that determine whether a post is eligible to be boosted.Triggers are organized in rule blocks, which share the same operator (“and” or “or”) between the rules contained in them. Rules can be created according to a wide set of parameters (also including the actual text of the posts!) and operators. An example of rule might be: “If the metric 'likes' on post 'xyz' is greater than 100 then boost that post”.
                          </p>

                            Once the Trigger has been defined, the process becomes almost identical to creating a new campaign: the Target and the Budget have to be set up, and then the automation is ready to go! It is also possible to reuse previously created Targets to further speed up the work flow. Like normal campaigns, each brand new set of Automatic Boost Posts rules is created “in pause”, so that you have the total control of this powerful feature and can decide to launch the automation whenever you like. Each time a new post will be boosted actively, you will be notified via e-mail.
                          </p>

                            It is also possible to have Pitchtarget automatically stop the Automatic Boost Posts by associating to it a Performance Rule you previously created to determine when it is opportune to stop boosting the post. This option is very useful in our opinion because it allows to save time and money, considering that Facebook charges for the Ads on a pay-as-you-go basis (you pay only for what you consume). For example, if you set an Automatic Boost Posts to reach a specific objective (e.g., 500 likes on that post) within a certain time span, and luckily you happen to reach that objective before the deadline originally set, the Stop Rule will allow you to save the money you would have spent if the Automatic Boost Posts rule had been running even after you had reached your objective.

                            Performance Rules is the Pitchtarget’s feature that allows you optimize your resources automatically, according to your own requests. When Performance Rules are appllied, Pitchtarget will monitor the performance of your Campaigns, Ad Sets or Ads and adjust them accordingly, following your instructions. In this way you can save a lot of time that you would have otherwise spent monitoring your Campaigns, while also saving money at the same time thanks to the adjustments produced by the Performance Rules.

                            The simplest example of how you could apply Performance Rules is creating a “stop rule”.  As you may know, Facebook adopts a pay-as-you-go policy, so that you only pay for what you actually consume (and not necessarily exhaust all your available budget everytime). You may have a specific objective when you launch certain Campaigns, Ad Sets or Ads. For instance, your objective could be achieving a number “x” of one or more specific metrics (likes, shares, impressions, ecc...) for a particular Ad Set. In the case where this objective is achieved before the expected end of the Ad Set’s life cycle, it may be optimal to immediately stop that Ad Set to avoid wasting money by overspending on it. This process can be automatically done by Pitchtarget through the application of a simple Performance Rule that will stop the Ad Set once the threshold determined by your objective is matched. In this way you can reallocate the remaining budget to other operations according to your needs, without having to constantly monitor the Ad Set’s performance.

                          <p class='text spacer spacer-top'>
                            To access the Performance Rules creation page, you have to click in the section “Rules” in the header of the tool.

                            If you already created Performance Rules, they will all be showed in a list within this section. By clicking on the “+” icon that will appear on each of the rules’ recap bar while passing the mouse cursor over it, you will be able to associate the considered rule to an element you like within a Strategy.

                            To create a new rule it is sufficient to click on the “create new Performance Rule” button on the Rules section and you will enter the guided creation procedure. You will have to specify a name for the rule and then create the Trigger in a way similar to the Automatic Boost Posts Trigger. First of all, you will need to specify the subject of your Rule (Campaign, Ad Set, any Ad Set in a Campaign, any Ad in a Campaign or any Ad in an Ad Set) and the time interval of the data to be considered by the rule (from “Today” to “Last 3 months”).<br>After this, you will have to create the Trigger, which is structured in the same way as the one of Automatic Boost Posts: it is organized in rule blocks, which share the same operator (“and” or “or”) between the rules contained in them. You can create rules combining together about 40 variables (metrics) and 6 operators. The meaning of each variable will be explained by clicking on the “i” icon located aside each variable’s name. <br>Once you defined the body of the rule, you will have to specify the action to be taken if the conditions are satisfied. The possible action are:

                            For the modifications on the bid or on the budget, it is possible to choose to increase\decrease the value in relative terms (e.g., increase\decrease by 10%) or in absolute terms (e.g., increase\decrease by 10€). In both cases, you will need to specify an upper bound (maximum) for each increase action and a lower bound (minimum) for each decrease action. Once the action is specified, you will have to select the “recipient” of that action. You can choose among Campaign, Ad, any Ad in a Campaign, any Ad Set in a Campaign, any matching Ad Set, any matching Ad.

                            After having determined what action to undertake and where to perform it, you will need to specify (under the heading “Apply this rule every”) the number of hours you want the rule to check whether the conditions you set are matched. Finally, you will need to provide an e-mail address that will be used to notify you whenever an automation starts.

                            It is possible to associate one or more Performance Rules to a Campaign,  Ad Set or to an Automatic Boost Posts. To do it, you need to go to the strategy list in “Strategies” and select the “edit strategy” icon of the Strategy containing the Campaigns, Ad Set or Automatic Boost Posts to which you want to apply your Performance Rules (the edit icon will appear when you pass your mouse cursor over the Strategy recap bar). Once inside the edit section of the Strategy, to associate a previously created Performance Rule to a Campaign you need to click on the “+” icon that will appear while you pass your mouse cursor over the Campaign or Automatic Boost Posts recap bar, and select the rules you want to attach to the Campaign. To associate a Performance Rule to an Automatic Boost Posts, once inside the edit section of the Strategy containing the interested element, select the edit icon of the Automatic Boost Posts you want to associate to the rule and then click on the “Associate Performance Rule” button at the bottom of the Trigger creation page. This action can be also performed at the same time of the Automatic Boost Posts creation, provided that the Performance Rule already exists.

                          However, remember that the ads will not be active until you say so: every Strategy and Campaign is created “in pause”, and to activate it you need to “turn on the switch” of the Campaign by clicking on it (the switch is illustrated in the picture). In this way, while Facebook does its review, you can do your own to check whether everything is all right. If you want the Campaign to go live as soon as Facebook officially gives its approval, you just need to turn on the Campaign’s switch right after you finish creating the last ad.

Once you press the “done” button you will be automatically redirected to the Dashboard.

                            Pitchtarget allows you to visualize the charts of every element of your Strategy you like (Campaigns, Ad Sets or Ads) for every metric you want. Pitchtarget will show the charts for two metrics at a time. You can select a different metric at anytime by deselecting the one you don’t want to analyse anymore and select the new one.

                            You can select or deselect the number of elements you want to compare on the charts at anytime. For example, if you want to analyse the graphs of only 2 out of the 4 Campaigns present in a Strategy, you just need to check the boxes that will appear in the left end of metrics bar of the element you want to select while you pass your mouse cursor over it. In this way, the Dashboard will display the charts  only for the selected elements.

                            At the Strategy level Dashboard, Pitchtarget will show the line charts of the selected metrics for the considered Campaigns. At the Campaign and Ad Set levels the Dashboard will show, additionally to the line charts, a further breakdown of the metric analysis by placement. The percentages relative to the results of the selected metrics on the basis of their placements (News Feed, Mobile, or Right-hand Column) will be shown through a donut chart or a list (according to the metric) which will be located aside of the line chart.

                            The heading “non_feed” in the donut charts identifies the metrics values registered with as placement the Right-hand Column Ads on desktop computers.

Thus, “right_hand” will refer to Ads shown in the Right-hand Column while the user is on the News Feed (Facebook’s home page), while “non_feed” will refer to Ads shown in the Right-hand Column while the user was exploring other Pages within Facebook (different from the News Feed).

                          Every element at every level on the dashboard has its own metrics bar that can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide additional information about that element, just like the recap bar of the “Strategies” section.  In particular, at the Ad Set level Dashboard, by expanding the metrics bar of an Ad, it is possible to get a preview of  the contents of the Ad, like pictures, videos, text and call to actions. This in our opinion is a really useful feature that allow to save a lot of time while monitoring the Campaign’s performance.

Together with the right-pointing arrow, there will appear other three (two for the Ad Set level Dashboard) icons that will enable to perform different action according to the level of the Dashboard you are in:

                          While you are in the “Strategies” section and you are facing the lists of the various Strategy recap bars, the hidden menu of each recap bar will show you four icons that, in order, will allow you to: add a new Campaign to the selected Strategy; edit the Campaigns of the Strategy (eventually adding an Automatic Boost Posts or associating a Performance Rule to it); delete the whole Strategy; enter the Dashboard at the Strategy level.

                                It is also possible to quickly activate or deactivate every Campaign, Ad Set or Ad at anytime in the Dashboard. You just need to turn on or off the switch which is located in the metrics bar under the element’s name. Moreover, in the metrics bar of the Ads it is possible to monitor the 1 to 10 relevance score of each single Ad, that Facebook will provide after the Ad is served more than 500 times.

                <p>A person's purchase is just the final step of a longer journey. It usually
                involves putting your brands in front of that person in the hope that he or she
                will eventually consider your products and purchase something from you. This
                process is widely known as the <strong>purchase funnel</strong> and it is one fundamental
                truth of modern marketing.</p>
                
                <p><img alt="The Purchase Funnel" src="/blog/2014/09/04/its-all-about-funnels/purchase_funnel.jpg" /></p>
                
                <p>In performance marketing, it is important to understand that there are other
                types of funnels. Your website traffic and the amount of conversions are
                strictly related – the more people enter into your website, the more chances you
                have to obtain a purchase from them. What actions can you take to get more
                conversions from your users?</p>
                
                <h3 id="enter-funnel">Enter funnel</h3>
                <p>As you already know, <strong>only few or your visitors will complete a purchase</strong>, and
                that's why it is important to work our the maths to know how many people you
                will need in order to get ROAS positive.</p>
                
                <p><img alt="Work out the maths" src="/blog/2014/09/04/its-all-about-funnels/funnel_bottleneck.jpg" /></p>
                
                <p>Suppose you have an audience of one million people. If 1.5% will click on your
                ads, it will mean that you will have only 15 thousand people landing on your
                website. If you have an optimistic 1% conversion rate, it will mean that you
                will get only 150 conversions out of 1 million potential people interested in
                your products.</p>
                
                <p>From your standpoint, the user journey from visit to purchase is quite a bumpy
                road. There are a few but important bottlenecks that prevent your visitors to
                buy what you are selling: <strong>Traffic and Audience, Click-Through Rate and
                Conversion Rate</strong>.</p>
                
                <h4 id="traffic-and-audience">1. Traffic and Audience</h4>
                <p>The first bottleneck is your website traffic. Are your traffic volumes high
                enough to make sure that you will get a critical mass of conversions? Before you
                start a direct response campaign, you should have your audience size clear in
                mind.</p>
                
                <p>When you determine your audience size, you should make sure that your campaign
                budget will be high enough to saturate or to cover the vast majority of that
                audience. Our platform will do its best to optimise your budget to make sure
                that you reach your audience more efficiently.</p>
                
                <p>Your campaign budget is like fuel for your car – the more you have, the further
                you'll go.</p>
                
                <h4 id="click-through-rate">2. Click-Through Rate</h4>
                <p>Now that you determined how many people do you expect to see in your website,
                you should make sure that they actually visit it. When you prepare an ad, you
                want to make sure that its image is appealing, and that the description invites
                the user to take action and visit your website. Great creatives yield great
                results, so make sure to make the most of your creative effort to make sure that
                people on Facebook will visit your website.</p>
                
                <p>But there's more. <strong>CTR is also affected by targeting</strong>. If you put the right ad
                in front of the right people, they will be more interested in your products.
                Remember, <strong>Facebook's is up to 90% accurate in targeting audiences</strong>, which
                means that it is very easy for you to find all of the people that matters to
                you.</p>
                
                <h4 id="conversion-rate">3. Conversion Rate</h4>
                <p>After your audience landed on your website, you should make sure that they will
                have a nice experience. If you give your visitors an awesome user experience,
                they will stay more on your ecommerce, and probably they will also shop more
                often. There are plenty of books on the matter, but the underlying logic is
                straightforward: do not overthink design, and give your users what they are
                looking for. Always optimise your product pages. You should strive to reduce the
                friction between an add to cart and a completed checkout.</p>
                
                <p>Marketers usually look at retargeting options such as real time bidding to
                improve their conversion rates, but this strategy is limited to desktop only and
                cannot take into account your users' visits into your website.</p>
                
                <p>We have many solutions that will allow you to retarget people cross-device.
